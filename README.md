# ICSI333_p4
Takes in input file and outputs STATS about the file (Group Project)

This C program was written at UAlbany for CSI333 with a partner. It is a program that works with a given file and allows you to get information about it. The string can be any arbitrary length, with some reason-ability expected. In fact one of the main functions of note here is the nextLine function whose purpose is to retrieve a string of any length, which it does using realloc. The following functions are allowed within the program.
1) prpat(pattern,file_name) - This function will take the given pattern and print any lines where the patterns occurs within the given file.
2) first(num_lines,file_name) - This function will print the asked for number of lines from the given file
3) diff(file_one,file_two) - This function will take in the names of two files and compares to see if they are the same. If they are not it will print the line number where they are different at.

The rest of the functions are written by my partner.

Multiple input and output files have been provided as well as the auxiliary files needed.
